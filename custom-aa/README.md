## Repository Overview 📂

Dive into the key sections of this repository:

- `/contracts`: All the essential smart contracts you need are neatly stored here.

- `/deploy`: Discover deployment and usage scripts tailored to assist your development process.

- `/test`: Unit tests for the provided contracts.

## Handy Commands 🛠️

Here's a lineup of commands to assist you:

- `yarn install`: Installs the required dependencies.
- `yarn compile`: Compiles the contracts.
- `yarn deploy:factory`: Deploys your contracts smoothly.
- `yarn deploy:multisig`: Executes the `deploy-multisig.ts` script.
- `yarn test`: Runs tests.

### Environment variables 🌳

To prevent the leakage of private keys, we use the `dotenv` package to load environment variables. This is particularly used to load the wallet private key, which is required to run the deployment script.

To use it, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and input your private key.

```
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=123cde574ccff....
```

### Local testing 🧪

Local tests make use of the in-memory-node thanks to the `hardhat-zksync-node` plugin. Please refer to [this section of the docs](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/testing/) for more details.
