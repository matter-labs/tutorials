# zkSync Tutorials

This document provides instructions for preparing the test infrastructure and running tests locally.

## The environment preparation

To execute tests, you need to install a local node (L2) from the following repository: https://github.com/matter-labs/era-test-node

1. Rust: era-test-node is written in Rust. Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. [Download Rust here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Install package:

```bash
yarn run install:local:node
```

3. Run the node:

```bash
yarn run launch:local:node
```

4. Run tests (before there needs to go the specific folder, eg. hello-world):

```bash
cd hello-world && yarn run test
```
